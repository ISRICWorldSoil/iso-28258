abstract: |

  This document introduces a generic data model developed at ISRIC implementing
  the ISO 28258 standard. Furthermore, the data model captures the extensive
  code-lists gathered in the GloSIS web ontology as thesauri. This data model is
  intended as a template to be specialised in particular projects or use cases.
  Soils4Africa was the first of such projects. Details are given on how model
  classes and associations were translated into tables and relations, together
  with maintenance and development guidelines.
