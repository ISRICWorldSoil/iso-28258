                <H1>Abstract</H1>
          <p>This document introduces a generic data model developed at
          ISRIC implementing the ISO 28258 standard. Furthermore, the
          data model captures the extensive code-lists gathered in the
          GloSIS web ontology as thesauri. This data model is intended
          as a template to be specialised in particular projects or use
          cases. Soils4Africa was the first of such projects. Details
          are given on how model classes and associations were
          translated into tables and relations, together with
          maintenance and development guidelines.</p>

<h1 data-number="1" id="sec:intro"><span
class="header-section-number">1</span> Introduction</h1>
<h2 data-number="1.1" id="sec:motivation"><span
class="header-section-number">1.1</span> Motivation</h2>
<p>In late 2021 a requirement emerged in the Soils4Africa project for a
relational database model directed at the storage of soil properties
observations. At first, the data model of the World Soil Information
Service (WoSIS) was considered. However, this path presented an
insurmountable challenge from the onset, as the WoSIS data model was
developed <em>ad hoc</em>, unrelated to the state-of-the-art in soil
ontology. In addition, this data model does not always follows best
practices in SQL and relational database modelling. Among the issues
with the WoSIS data model, the following can be highlighted:</p>
<ul>
<li>absence of thesauri or other mechanisms for controlled content;</li>
<li>data type mismatches, e.g. numerical values stored in text
fields;</li>
<li>functional dependencies (marked with the concept of
“attribute”);</li>
<li>unclear semantics (in the data model and documentation).</li>
</ul>
<p>While not the most severe issue, the lack of controlled thesauri
renders the WoSIS data model nearly unusable outside the context for
which it was developed. The other issues carry risks for maintenance and
data accuracy that can easily become too expensive to address.</p>
<h2 data-number="1.2"
id="sec:the-option-for-an-international-standard"><span
class="header-section-number">1.2</span> The option for an international
standard</h2>
<p>A second path was thus considered, developing a more general data
model following the state-of-the-art in soil ontology. Several models
have been proposed as basis for the exchange of soil data that offer a
starting point for a data model. No thorough comparison was undertaken
between the different options, the domain model proposed in the ISO
28258 standard was adopted outright for a first prototype. ISO 28258 is
the only truly international standard directed at soil data exchange,
with the alternatives being primarily regional in nature (e.g. INSPIRE,
ANZSoilML). Soils4Africa taking place in a different continent, and with
the goal of a generic data model in mind, the international model was
the default choice. Further details on how these different models
compare are offered in Section 2.2.</p>
<p>The ISO 28258 domain model provides a “shell” architecture meant to
be specialised for particular contexts. Initial data model prototyping
proved that to be the case. Moreover, the parenthood of ISO 28258 to the
GloSIS web ontology also facilitated the use of controlled content
referenceable on the web.</p>
<h2 data-number="1.3" id="sec:structure"><span
class="header-section-number">1.3</span> Structure</h2>
<p>This document is structured as follows. Section 2 briefly presents
the ISO 28258 standard and the domain model it proposes, also comparing
with other relevant models in soil ontology. The features of interest
included in the data model are introduced next, in Section 3, after
which the observations and measurements assets are presented in Section
4. Section 5 details the procedures employed to populate the thesauri
and their intended use. Meta-data is addressed in Section 6. Some
relevant operational aspects of the data model are discussed in Section
7. The document concludes by pointing directions for future work in
Section 8.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Data model</strong>: a logical structure for the storage of
a data (usually in a digital system). In most cases a data model
implements the informational aspect of a domain model. In this document
relations in a data model are represented with lower case e.g.,
<code>element</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Domain Model</strong>: an abstraction synthesising the
information (and in some cases behaviour) of a specific domain. Often
represented with a visual language like UML. A domain model can also be
referred as “ontology”. In this document classes or concepts in a domain
model are represented with capital characters,
e.g. <code>SoilElement</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Feature of Interest</strong>: a class in the Observations
and Measurements domain model representing the subject of an observation

class="header-section-number">2</span> The ISO 28258 domain model</h1>
<h2 data-number="2.1" id="sec:overview"><span
class="header-section-number">2.1</span> Overview</h2>
<p>The international standard “Soil quality - Digital exchange of
soil-related data” (ISO number 28258) <span class="citation"
data-cites="ISO-28258">(<span>“<span class="nocase">Soil quality –
Digital exchange of soil-related data</span>”</span> 2013)</span> is the
result of a joint effort by the ISO technical committee “Soil quality”
and the technical committee “Soil characterisation” of the European
Committee for Standardisation (CEN). Recognising a growing need to
combine soil data with other types of data - especially environmental -
these committees set out to produce a general framework for the
unambiguous recording and exchange of soil data, consistent with other
international standards and independent of particular software
systems.</p>
<p>The ISO 28258 standard was from the onset developed to target an XML
based implementation. Its goal was not necessarily to attain a common
understanding of the domain, rather to design a digital soil data
exchange infrastructure. Therefore the accompanying UML domain model on
which the XML exchange schema is rooted was merely a means to an end.
Also recognising the relevance of spatial positioning in soil data, the
standard adopted the Geography Markup Language (GML) as a geo-spatial
extension to the XML encoding.</p>
<p>Even though not necessarily focused on a domain model, ISO 28258
captures a relatively wide range of concepts from soil surveying and
physio-chemical analysis. The domain model is a direct application of
the meta-model proposed in the Observations and Measurements (O&amp;M)
standard <span class="citation" data-cites="ISO-19156">(<span>“<span
class="nocase">Geographic information – Observations and
measurements</span>”</span> 2011)</span> to the soil domain. It aims to
support both analytical and descriptive results.</p>
<p>ISO 28258 identifies the following features of interest:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Site</code> - representing the surrounding environment of a
soil investigation, the subject of observations such as terrain or land
use.</li>
<li><code>Plot</code> - the location or spatial feature where a soil
investigation is conducted, usually leading to a soil profile
description and/or to the collection of soil material for
physio-chemical analysis. <code>Plot</code> is further specialised into
<code>Surface</code>, <code>TrialPit</code> and
<code>Borehole</code>.</li>
<li><code>Profile</code> - an ordered set of soil horizons or layers
comprising the soil pedon at a specific spatial location. The object of
soil classification.</li>
<li><code>ProfileElement</code> - an element of a soil profile,
characterised by an upper and lower depth. Specialised into
<code>Horizon</code> - a pedo-genetically homogeneous segment of the
soil profile - and <code>Layer</code> - an arbitrary and heterogeneous
segment of the soil profile.</li>
<li><code>SoilSpecimen</code> - an homogenised sample of soil material
collected at a specific soil depth. Usually meant for physio-chemical
analysis.</li>
</ul>
<p>Figure 1 presents a simplified diagram of the ISO 28258 domain model
showing the relevant relations between features of interest.</p>

<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Figure 1: Simplified UML class diagram
with ISO 28258 features of interest.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Meant as an asset for global use, ISO 28258 did not went into further
specialisation. It does not propose attribute catalogues, vocabularies
or code-lists of any kind, remaining open to the different soil
description and classification systems used around the world. Although
specifying a class for the traditional concept of “mapping soil unit”
used in vector based soil mapping, the standard does not actually
support the raster data paradigm. ISO 28258 was conceived as an empty
container, to be subject of further specialisation for the actual
encoding of soil data (possibly at regional or national scale). However,
the standard has so far never been applied in this context it was
designed for. The combination of a XML/GML approach (for which
off-the-shelf tools remain scant) with the lack of code-lists possibly
made the outright adoption of this standard too abstract for soil data
providers.</p>
<h2 data-number="2.2" id="sec:28258:relation"><span
class="header-section-number">2.2</span> Relation with other soil
ontologies</h2>
<p>The ISO 28258 domain model is semantically rooted in O&amp;M (see
Section 4 for details), re-using UML stereotypes from that standard
throughout. This architecture automatically aligns ISO 28258 with other
standards from ISO and the OGC, such as Sampling Features. Moreover, it
also provides alignment with other soil ontologies that follow a similar
philosophy.</p>
<h3 data-number="2.2.1" id="sec:inspire-soil-theme"><span
class="header-section-number">2.2.1</span> INSPIRE Soil Theme</h3>
<p>Perhaps the most relevant among the domain models related to ISO
28258 is the Soil Theme domain model published by the European
Commission in the context of the INSPIRE directive <span
class="citation" data-cites="INSPIRE-Soil">(Soil 2013)</span>. The core
of these two models, concerning the abstraction of observations and
measurements is by and large the same, with the concept of
<code>Observation</code> expressed as a triple: <code>Property</code>,
<code>Procedure</code> and <code>Unit</code>. As for the features of
interest there are differences mainly in how the spatial surrounding of
a soil investigation is abstracted. The concepts of <code>Plot</code>
and <code>Site</code> are also present in INSPIRE but in a leaner way,
without the specialisations found in ISO 28258. INSPIRE further adds the
concept of <code>SoilBody</code>, a wider spatial area in which various
soil investigations are conducted. And the concepts of
<code>RectifiedGridCoverage</code> and
<code>ReferenceableGridCoverage</code> provide a back-bone for gridded
data.</p>
<h3 data-number="2.2.2" id="sec:ogc-soilie"><span
class="header-section-number">2.2.2</span> OGC SoilIE</h3>
<p>In 2016 the OGC hosted an initiative named Soil Interoperability
Experiment (SoilIE) <span class="citation"
data-cites="OGC-SoilIE">(<span>“<span>OGC Soil Data Interoperability
Experiment</span>”</span> 2016)</span> with similar goals to those of
ISO 28258. Also focused on data exchange, SoilIE would go into far more
detail concerning features of interest. The resulting domain model is
sub-divided into four sub-models, each addressing a specific aspect of
soil information: (i) soil classification; (ii) soil profile
description; (iii) sampling and field/laboratory observations; and (iv)
sensor-based monitoring of dynamic soil properties. Left out of the
experiment were soil mapping and landscape/land-use
characterisation.</p>
<p>The SoilIE domain model yields familiar concepts such as
<code>Site</code>, <code>Plot</code>, <code>Soil</code>,
<code>Layer</code>, <code>Horizon</code> or <code>Sample</code>. But
these are complemented by many other classes, in what is a far broader
set of features of interest, with more intricate relationships. However,
to what observations and measures is concerned, the same patterns
proposed in the O&amp;M standard are applied in this domain model
too.</p>
<h3 data-number="2.2.3" id="sec:glosis"><span
class="header-section-number">2.2.3</span> GloSIS</h3>
<p>The GloSIS web ontology is essentially a translation of the ISO 28258
domain model to the Semantic Web, employing the Ontology Web Language
(OWL). While semantically it is the same model, GloSIS introduces large
sets of ready to use code-lists, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Descriptive properties values (transposed from the FAO Guidelines
of Soil Description <span class="citation" data-cites="Jahn2006">(Jahn
et al. 2006)</span>).</p></li>
<li><p>Physio-chemical properties (for Layer, Horizon, Plot and
Profile).</p></li>
<li><p>Procedures associated with physio-chemical properties (re-used
from the Africa Soil Profiles project <span class="citation"
data-cites="Leenaars2014">(Leenaars, Van Oostrum, and Ruiperez Gonzalez
2014)</span>).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>By adopting the Semantic Web paradigm, this ontology automatically
expresses all its content with Universal Resource Identifiers (URIs),
than can easily be rendered dereferencable with a service such as W3ID
<span class="citation" data-cites="w3id">(Group 2022)</span>. The GloSIS
web ontology has in this way become one of the most extensive resources
on soil ontology on the web.</p>
<h2 data-number="2.3" id="sec:issues-identified"><span
class="header-section-number">2.3</span> Issues identified</h2>
<p>During the course of this work various issues were identified with
the ISO domain model that required addressing in the adaptation to the
Soils4Africa project. In particular:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>The <code>Surface</code> and <code>Site</code> concepts revealed
too similar and difficult to distinguish by soil scientists. Although
yielding slightly different properties, the domain model is not fully
clear. Moreover, a polygon type of spatial feature is expected to have a
one-to-one relation with a <code>Profile</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>The <code>SoilSpecimen</code> concept is defined with a single
depth property, whereas in soil surveying a sample collected in the
field is always reported with two depths (upper and lower boundaries). A
specimen (or sample) is regarded as a tangible segment of the soil
profile whose material is homogenised.</p></li>
<li><p><code>SoilSpecimen</code> and <code>Layer</code> appear also as
too similar concepts. Both report to an arbitrary segment or stratum of
the soil profile, in most cases unrelated to pedo-genetic horizon
boundaries. Moreover, soil properties assessed in laboratories from soil
specimens are often reported in reference to a soil layer by data
providers. The depth issue noted above blurs the distinction between the
two concepts even further.</p></li>
</ol>
<h1 data-number="3" id="sec:foi"><span
class="header-section-number">3</span> Features of Interest</h1>
<h2 data-number="3.1" id="sec:general"><span
class="header-section-number">3.1</span> General</h2>
<p>The ISO 28258 domain model was translated into a relational data
model in the most seamless way possible. Whenever practical, classes and
their attributes were translated directly into relations and attributes
(or tables and columns). Generalisations were dealt with case-by-case,
applying the child relations rules, i.e. creating individual entities
for the children only if they bear diverse relations with other classes.
This section reviews the entities and relationships implementing the
features of interest (FoIs) and related assets.</p>
<h2 data-number="3.2" id="sec:project-and-site"><span
class="header-section-number">3.2</span> Project and Site</h2>
<p>The first concept to introduce is that of <code>Project</code>, a
general placeholder providing the context of the data collection
activity. The ISO domain model considers this a prerequisite for the
proper use or reuse of these data. Within a project one or more soil
investigations take place. It can be a soil sampling campaign, a regular
soil survey, or some other organised process of soil data collection.
The table <code>project</code> contains a single field for the project
name, exposing the open nature of this concept (Figure 2).</p>
<p>A project can be related to one or more other projects. For instance,
if a certain field campaign occurs at regular time intervals, the user
might wish to record each as a single project, but related to others
undertaken at a different time. Hierarchical relations can also be
recorded this way, expressing a certain project as sub-project of
another one. The table <code>project_related</code> provides the
<code>role</code> field in which the user may express the nature of the
relationship.</p>
<p>A soil investigation takes place within a certain spatial area or
extent: the <code>Site</code>. A site is not a spatial feature of
interest, but provides the link between the spatial features of interest
(<code>Plot</code>) to the <code>Project</code>. It can be expressed
either as a location (point) or spatial extent (polygon). The fields
<code>position</code> and <code>extent</code> in the <code>site</code>
table provide for this information, being that only one may be non empty
for each record.</p>
<figure>
<img src="diagrams/project-site.png" id="fig:foi:project"
alt="Figure 2: Entity-Relationship diagram for the project and site entities." />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Figure 2: Entity-Relationship diagram for
the <code>project</code> and <code>site</code> entities.</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2 data-number="3.3" id="sec:spatial-features"><span
class="header-section-number">3.3</span> Spatial Features</h2>
<p>All features of interest in the ISO 28258 model relate to a site,
directly or indirectly. It is not possible to express information
without previously defining the spatial extent within which the soil
investigation took place. A single site may host more than one
investigation, thus assumed to have an heterogeneous soil
composition.</p>
<p>The soil investigation itself is conducted in a precise spatial
location - the <code>Plot</code> - the first spatial feature of
interest. The <code>Plot</code> can be of three different kinds:
<code>Surface</code>, <code>Pit</code> or <code>Borehole</code>. The
<code>Surface</code> corresponds spatially to a polygonal feature, a
spatial extent within which the character of the soil tends to be
homogeneous. <code>Surface</code> can express soil investigations
recorded with high positional inaccuracy. The model also defines a
hierarchical relation between surfaces.</p>
<p>Both the <code>Borehole</code> and the <code>Pit</code> correspond to
point type spatial features, translating locations recorded with good
positional accuracy. A borehole represents soil investigations conducted
with an auger or similar boring instrument, whereas a pit indicates a
soil excavation activity. In practice, both <code>Borehole</code> and
<code>Pit</code> yield the same properties and relations,
undistinguishable as data structures.</p>
<p>The <code>Plot</code> was thus modelled with two tables: one for the
<code>Surface</code> and another - named <code>plot</code> - for
<code>Borehole</code> and <code>Pit</code>. Both of these have a
mandatory relation to a site. The <code>plot</code> table has a
<code>Point</code> type column as spatial feature and
<code>surface</code> a <code>Polygon</code> type column. As Figure 3
shows, the <code>plot</code> table contains a different set of
columns.</p>
<p>The <code>plot</code> and <code>surface</code> tables provide the
spatial hook on which to record a soil <code>Profile</code> (a vertical
sequence of soil horizons). The resulting <code>profile</code> table is
rather simple, yielding a <code>code</code> column and two foreign keys,
one for <code>plot</code> and another for <code>surface</code>. A
<code>CHECK</code> constraint forces one, and only one of these two
foreign keys to be used simultaneously.</p>
<p>Note the nature of the relation between <code>Plot</code> and
<code>Profile</code> being one-to-many. Meaning that more than one
profile can be associated with the same plot (of whatever kind). This
kind of association is not meant to related profiles collected at
different points in time to a same plot. In such case the two profiles
would be in different projects and would thus relate to different
plots.</p>
<figure>
<img src="diagrams/profile-plot.png" id="fig:foi:profile"
alt="Figure 3: Entity-Relationship diagram for the profile and plot entities." />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Figure 3: Entity-Relationship diagram for
the <code>profile</code> and <code>plot</code> entities.</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2 data-number="3.4" id="sec:other-features-of-interest"><span
class="header-section-number">3.4</span> Other Features of Interest</h2>
<p>There are three further features that do not have spatial expression
but still are passible or measurement. Two are the profile elements:
<code>Layer</code> and <code>Horizon</code>, the third being the
<code>SoilSpecimen</code>.</p>
<p><code>Layer</code> and <code>Horizon</code> present a similar nature:
a section of the soil profile starting and ending at defined depths.
Each instance is recorded in a particular order, re-creating the full
soil profile. Semantically, <code>Layer</code> and <code>Horizon</code>
differ in their composition, the latter is homogeneous, the former
heterogeneous. An horizon is identified by field observation, through
sharp transitions of colour, composition or texture. Layer depths are
usually pre-determined prior to field work. However, this difference
does not translate into different properties or relations in the data
model. Therefore, both <code>Layer</code> and <code>Horizon</code> are
captured in a single table: <code>element</code>. The field
<code>type</code> provides the means to distinguish between layer or
horizon, if needed be. Figure 4 provides an overview of these
relations.</p>
<p>The simultaneous inclusion of the properties
<code>upper_depth</code>, <code>lower_depth</code> and
<code>order</code> rapports important redundancies that are worth
noting. The depth fields are recorded as positive integers representing
centimetres from the surface, increasing downwards. The data model
forces <code>upper_depth</code> to be lower than
<code>lower_depth</code>. However the model cannot prevent overlapping
profile elements from being recorded. Likewise, it cannot guarantee
consistency between <code>order</code> and the depth columns. These
redundancies are translated from the domain model “as is” since they
portray common practice in soil survey. For these issues to be fully
addressed a business rules layer is necessary (e.g. with database stored
procedures).</p>
<p>The concept of <code>SoilSpecimen</code> in ISO 28258 is derived from
the ISO 10381 standard for Soil Sampling <span class="citation"
data-cites="iso10381">(Standardization Organization) 2002)</span>. In
essence it is a portion of soil matter (implicitly assumed as
homogeneous) collected at a certain depth, meant to be transported to a
storage facility where it may be further prepared and analysed with
different methods. It does not appear directly associated to any
specific feature in the ISO 28258 domain model, but its parent structure
in ISO 10381 indicates possible associations with spatial features that
may function as sampling platforms. The WoSIS database includes a
similar concept, <code>sample</code> that appears associated with a site
or plot. The same approach was thus taken in the ISO 28258 data model
with a one-to-many association between <code>plot</code> and
<code>specimen</code>. An additional table,
<code>specimen_prep_process</code>, provides essential attributes to
record how a sample is transported and stored.</p>

<p>O&amp;M <span class="citation" data-cites="ISO-19156">(<span>“<span
class="nocase">Geographic information – Observations and
measurements</span>”</span> 2011)</span> presents a general framework to
encode measurements of natural phenomena of any kind. The concept of
<code>Observation</code> is at its core, in essence a triplet of three
other concepts:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>Property</code>: an individual characteristic of a feature
of interest. E.g. sand fraction in a profile element.</p></li>
<li><p><code>Procedure</code>: an action performed on a feature of
interest (or sampling feature) in order to measure a property. E.g.
sieving with 2 mm and 0.05 mm grades.</p></li>
<li><p><code>Unit of measure</code>: defines the magnitude of a
measurement executed with a particular procedure on a property. E.g. per
mille.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The <code>Result</code> class provides the actual placeholder for
measurement results. It refers to a feature of interest and an
observation and provides a matching value. The nature of this value is
left completely open, it can be of any kind.</p>
<h2 data-number="4.2" id="sec:physio-chemical-observations"><span
class="header-section-number">4.2</span> Physio-chemical
Observations</h2>
<p>Observations of physio-chemical properties of the soil provide a full
introduction to the implementation of O&amp;M in a relational database.
These observations produce numerical results and refer to relatively
well known procedures of wet chemistry and related soil specimen
treatment.</p>
<p>The model proposed by O&amp;M can be transposed to a relational
structure nearly literally, however, there is an important choice to
make regarding the nature of the relevant feature of interest. Since
<code>Result</code> ought to refer to a feature, it must be translated
into as many relational tables as many different features of interest
exist. Therefore corresponding result tables are necessary for
<code>surface</code>, <code>plot</code>, <code>profile</code>,
<code>element</code> and <code>specimen</code>.</p>
<p>Considering physio-chemical observations, in practice only
<code>Element</code> and <code>Specimen</code> yield observations of
this nature, with numerical values as result. For <code>element</code>
the observation tables include the suffix <code>_phys_chem</code>
whereas for specimen it is <code>numerical_specimen</code>. If further
features of interest come to require numerical observations this suffix
system must be harmonised.</p>
<p>The <code>observation</code> table is in essence a ternary
association, with foreign keys to <code>property</code>,
<code>procedure</code> and <code>results</code>. In addition the columns
<code>value_min</code> and <code>value_max</code> provide an interval of
admissible values to guarantee data consistency (e.g. per mille). Figure
5 provides an overview of the observation assets for the
<code>element</code> entity.</p>
<p>The tables for <code>property</code>, <code>procedure</code> and
<code>results</code> are thesauri, not meant for direct modification by
users. They provide the controlled content in this segment of the data
model. In all three tables the natural columns are a human readable
<code>label</code> and an <code>uri</code> to an entry in an on-line
controlled vocabulary. This configuration is specifically designed to
align the data model with the GloSIS web ontology (details in Section
5), but it also facilitates referencing other on-line sources of
controlled content. The <code>procedure</code> table includes an
additional foreign key to itself, for the encoding of hierarchical
procedures, with different levels of detail.</p>
<p>Closing this segment of the data model is the <code>result</code>
table. It refers both to an <code>observation</code> and a feature of
interest (<code>element</code> for <code>result_phys_chem</code> and
<code>specimen</code> for <code>result_numeric_specimen</code>). A
numeric column named <code>value</code> hosts the actual measurement. To
each numerical result table a trigger is associated that on insertion or
update verifies the value against the <code>value_min</code> and
<code>value_max</code> columns in the associated observation. In case it
is outside the admissible interval, an exception is raised and the value
remains unchanged.</p>

<h2 data-number="4.3" id="sec:descriptive-observations"><span
class="header-section-number">4.3</span> Descriptive Observations</h2>
<p>Various of the soil properties assessed during field work provide
qualitative or descriptive results from direct observation, dispensing
laboratory analysis. Examples are water drainage or soil classification.
Results from these observations are thus textual in nature, ideally in
reference to controlled content sources.</p>
<p>Compared to numerical observations, the main difference in the
translation of the O&amp;M pattern to a relational model for descriptive
observations is in the nature of the result, it becomes a reference
(foreign key) to a thesaurus. A thesaurus provides a list of controlled
terms or items, that as a rule may not be modified by system users.</p>
<p>All features of interest can be subject to descriptive observations.
Therefore the O&amp;M pattern is replicated to each one, with a suffix
to the table making the distinction. An exception was opened to the
procedures thesaurus. In this case a procedure is a publication (field
manual, soil description guidelines, etc) of which few are expected and
should apply equally to different features of interest. Figure 6
presents the tables for the descriptive observations related to
<code>Surface</code>, thus yielding the suffix <code>_surface</code>.
Similar tables exist for <code>plot</code>, <code>profile</code> and
<code>element</code>.</p>
<p>A <code>property_desc</code> table provides the thesaurus for
properties, just like in the numerical observations case.
<code>thesaurus_desc</code> provides the additional controlled lists of
descriptive terms to associate with properties.
<code>procedure_desc</code> hosts then the thesaurus of publications.
The <code>observation_desc</code> table relates these previous concepts
in a ternary relationship as before.</p>
<p>The <code>result_desc</code> table is simply composed by two
references, one to the feature of interest and another to the
observation. The latter is actually a composed foreign key with the
primary keys of the property and the respective item in the descriptive
thesaurus. A joint unique constraint is applied on the foreign keys to
the feature of interest and the property, guaranteeing that only one
result is recorded for each property of each feature of interest.</p>

<h2 data-number="5.1" id="sec:glosis-code-lists"><span
class="header-section-number">5.1</span> GloSIS code-lists</h2>
<p>One of the advancements GloSIS brings to soil ontology is the
introduction of comprehensive and structured code-lists. Making the best
use of the Semantic Web, these code-lists are structured according the
Simple Knowledge Ontology System (SKOS) <span class="citation"
data-cites="miles2009skos">(Miles and Bechhofer 2009)</span> with each
item fully de-referenceable. SKOS also makes these code-lists easily
extendable.</p>
<p>GloSIS currently comprises code-lists for three cases:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Descriptive property values</strong>: as digitised from
the FAO Guidelines for Soil Description during the consultancy work for
Pillar 5 of GSP <span class="citation"
data-cites="SchleidtReznik2020">(Řezník and Schleidt 2020)</span>. Some
830 codes are currently found in these code-lists.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Physio-chemical properties</strong>: in accordance to the
Tier1/Tier2 inventory gathered within the Pillar 4 of GSP <span
class="citation" data-cites="BatjesTier1-2">(Batjes, Kempen, and Egmond
2019)</span>, comprising 80 individual items.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Physio-chemical procedures</strong>: adapted from the
large catalogue assembled within the Africa Soil Profiles project (AfSP)
<span class="citation" data-cites="Leenaars2014">(Leenaars, Van Oostrum,
and Ruiperez Gonzalez 2014)</span>, currently totalling over 200
individuals.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Beyond these code-lists, the GloSIS ontology also embodies a large
collection of descriptive soil properties. However, these are not
modelled as code-lists, but rather as direct instances of the
<code>Property</code> class from the SOSA ontology. Over 160 such
properties currently exist in the ontology, across all features of
interest.</p>
<p>These collections of controlled content provide a wealth of
information form which to start a soil information system or an <em>ad
hoc</em> database as the one described in this document. The GloSIS
ontology is currently hosted at the W3ID service set-up by the W3C <a
href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>, guaranteeing an important level of
resilience. Moreover, GloSIS remains in active development with
accompanying tools that will facilitate the involvement of soil
scientists.</p>
<p>SoilIE attempted a similar approach to controlled content, also
producing code-lists with dereferenceble items. However, these are no
longer on-line so it is not possible to compare their
implementation.</p>
<h2 data-number="5.2" id="sec:sparql-transformations"><span
class="header-section-number">5.2</span> SPARQL transformations</h2>
<p>A series of transformations were created to obtain relational
database records from the GloSIS ontology. They are coded as SPARQL
queries and stored in the <code>sparql</code> folder of the code
repository <a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a>. Each of these queries obtain as
output a set of SQL <code>INSERT</code> instructions that for each
code-list item create a counterpart record in the corresponding
thesaurus in the database.</p>
<p>The query in Listing 1 populates the thesaurus for descriptive
properties associated with the <code>GL_Profile</code> class in GloSIS
(<code>Profile</code> in ISO 28258). First, it identifies the relevant
observations, those whose feature of interest is the
<code>Gl_Profile</code> class (with the
<code>sosa:hasFeatureOfInterest</code> predicate). Secondly, it
identifies the associated properties with the
<code>sosa:observedProperty</code> element. It then identifies the
associated result and corresponding values code-list
(<code>sosa:hasResult</code>). Using the <code>BIND</code> function the
resulting SQL <code>INSERT</code> instruction is produced as a string.
Similar SPARQL queries were developed for all other features of
interest.</p>

<h2 data-number="6.1" id="sec:requirements"><span
class="header-section-number">6.1</span> Requirements</h2>
<p>O&amp;M does not consider meta-data directly, an aspect that is
beyond the scope of the ontology. However, ISRIC identified the need to
register individuals responsible for certain laboratory measurements and
field observations. This information can be critical to keep track of
laboratory work. Also regarding field work, this information can be
crucial to trace irregularities and obtain clarification from the
institutions involved.</p>
<p>vCard, the meta-data ontology specified by the W3C <span
class="citation" data-cites="iannella2014vcard">(Iannella and McKinney
2014)</span> and the ISO 19115 standard for geo-spatial meta-data <span
class="citation" data-cites="ISO-19115">(<span>“<span
class="nocase">geographic information — metadata</span>”</span>
2014)</span> were initially considered as semantic sources. The Dublin
Core vocabulary <span class="citation"
data-cites="baker2005maintaining">(Baker 2005)</span> was also taken
into consideration. vCard came to be the main source as it matched
closer the organisational information commonly related to soil
surveys.</p>
<h2 data-number="6.2" id="sec:data-model"><span
class="header-section-number">6.2</span> Data model</h2>
<h3 data-number="6.2.1" id="sec:overview-1"><span
class="header-section-number">6.2.1</span> Overview</h3>
<p>The current data model is primarily based on the vCard classes
<code>Organisation</code>, <code>Individual</code> and
<code>Address</code> with respective tables for each (Figure 7). An
organisation is typically a set of individuals that work together
towards a same goal (or set of goals), but its meaning can be taken more
broadly depending on the context. In most countries organisations are
legal entities. Semantically the relevance is in distinguishing the
collective from an individual. Organisations have a name and can be
contacted through an e-mail address or a telephone number. They also may
have a URL locating them in the digital space. Organisations can be set
up in a hierarchical fashion, through a parent-child relationship.
Organisations can also be sub-divided in various units
(<code>organisation_unit</code> table).</p>
<p>The individual is a person, usually subject to a set of legal rights
and obligations. The individual has a name and honorific title and can
be contacted by e-mail or telephone. An individual can also have a URL
to a web page of interest. Individuals can be part of an indefinite
number of organisations (through the
<code>organisation_individual</code> table). They may instead relate
directly to a particular unit inside an organisation.</p>
<p>The <code>address</code> table provides structure for physical postal
addresses of individuals and organisations. Currently the relations to
this table are one-to-many, allowing for various individuals to have the
same address. This is a somewhat permissive structure, following the
open nature of vCard, that may be made more restrictive if
necessary.</p>

<h3 data-number="6.2.2" id="sec:encapsulation"><span
class="header-section-number">6.2.2</span> Encapsulation</h3>
<p>The entities created for the meta-data model are stored in their own
database schema, named <code>metadata</code>. This limits the number of
tables in the main schema (named <code>core</code>) facilitating human
interaction with the database and its documentation. Foreign keys from
the <code>core</code> schema to the <code>metadata</code> schema provide
the appropriate relations between the two.</p>
<p>Not all database management systems (DBMS) implement the concept of
schema laid out in the SQL standard. Some include the concept but do not
provided standard interaction. Therefore this option for encapsulating
the meta-data entities in their own schema limits the range of DBMS that
can host this database.</p>
<h2 data-number="6.3" id="sec:relations-with-iso-28258-entities"><span
class="header-section-number">6.3</span> Relations with ISO 28258
entities</h2>
<p>With a meta-data data model established, relations with the ISO 28258
entities were devised, reflecting expectations on the field work
conducted within Soils4Africa and similar projects. These relations
identify the organisations and individuals responsible for data
collection and/or asset storage. A simple matrix of relations was
developed to aid discussion with domain experts (Table 1).</p>

<p>A project may involve one or more organisations responsible for
conducting a survey, or any other kind of soil investigation, including
one or more plots. Each plot is surveyed by one or more individuals that
in principle must be present at location. This resulted in the tables
<code>project_organisation</code>, <code>plot_individual</code> and
<code>surface_individual</code>. The individuals associated with a plot
are also responsible for all descriptive results gathered on the
profiles and profile elements surveyed within the plot.</p>
<p>Neither elements nor profiles refer to individuals or organisations.
These entities are part of the investigation conducted on the plot and
therefore associated to the respective individual. However, the
specimens surveyors collect are sent to a storage facility hosted by an
organisation that must be identified. It is also necessary to track
individuals responsible for physio-chemical measurements conducted in
laboratories. Hence a direct reference from this kind of result to the
<code>individual</code> table.</p>

<p>The database documented in this manuscript is developed with the
migrations framework from the Graphile project <a href="#fn5"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a>.
Migrations provide a versioning mechanism for the incremental
development of a database. The tool facilitates rolling back and forth
between different points in the development history, by applying or
suppressing the SQL instructions that create the database structure.</p>
<p>Listing 5 provides a simple example on how to deploy the ISO 28258
database with <code>graphile-migrate</code>. First the repository is
cloned from the code forge, then the <code>.env</code> file must be
edited to point environmental variables to the correct database cluster.
Finally the environmental variables are loaded to the session and the
migrations are run.</p>

<p>The database document here is likely to evolve in the future, simply
with the correction of bugs or the introduction of general requirements,
as is the case with the <code>metadata</code> schema. Any modifications
to the entities described in Section 3 through Section 6 must therefore
percolate to any downstream databases, i.e. those developed from this
template. This is best managed with migrate setup script, usually stored
in the downstream <code>migrations/setup</code> folder. Modifications to
the <code>iso28258</code> repository can then be reflected in this
script. The steps to produce one are the following:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Apply the necessary modifications with a new migration in the
<code>iso28258</code> repository.</p></li>
<li><p>Create a new tag in the <code>iso28258</code> repository, marking
a new release.</p></li>
<li><p>Obtain a backup from the <code>iso28258</code> repository with
the <code>pg_dump</code> tool, marking the resulting file with the
version (e.g. <code>_v1.1</code>). This dump must include only the
<code>core</code> and <code>metadata</code> schemas, ignore ownership
and add data as <code>INSERT</code> instructions, as Listing 6
exemplifies.</p></li>
<li><p>Replace the setup script in the <code>migrations/setup</code>
folder of the downstream repository.</p></li>
<li><p>Update the <code>.gmrc</code> file in the downstream repository
to load the new script (<code>"afterReset"</code> section).</p></li>
<li><p>Fully re-run migrations in the downstream database
(<code>reset</code> parameter).</p></li>

<h2 data-number="8.1" id="sec:uncertainties"><span
class="header-section-number">8.1</span> Uncertainties</h2>
<p>The estimation and recording of measurement uncertainties has been a
topic of active research at ISRIC. However, this aspect has so far been
left outside soil ontology initiatives. The absence of uncertainty
elements in O&amp;M itself is a contributing factor to this state of
affairs.</p>
<p>Measurement uncertainty is likely associated with the procedures
employed. Particularly those used in the laboratory, but so too in field
observations. Beyond those, spectral models also carry intrinsic
estimate uncertainties that can be relevant to store.</p>
<p>In the data model, uncertainties are expected to be primarily
associated with entities implementing Procedure-type classes of O&amp;M.
However, other aspects may also warrant this kind of information.
Positioning uncertainty is an example. Results themselves may be subject
to uncertainties too, for instance to convey particular conditions to
field work. This area of soil ontology likely requires further
refinement in requirements before it can be introduced to the data
model.</p>
<h2 data-number="8.2"
id="sec:maintaining-the-downstream-synchronicity-to-iso-28258"><span
class="header-section-number">8.2</span> Maintaining the downstream
synchronicity to ISO 28258</h2>
<p>Once a downstream data model starts being used effectively, storing
actual results records, the integration procedure with the parent ISO
data model, described in Section 7.2, becomes less evident. Some
modifications may be straightforward to apply in the same fashion,
e.g. adding a new, nullable column to an existing table. But others may
imply modifications to existing records, that do not fit within the
existing procedure.</p>
<p>Two approaches are possible to this issue. First is to devise an
additional strategy to apply changes from the parent model without loss
or corruption of data. This likely requires an additional backup and
restore mechanism. The other approach is to simply let the two data
models diverge. While not optimal, this latter approach is by far the
cheapest, and if the parent model is not expected to evolve much
further, it might not have much consequence.</p>
